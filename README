powerdebug
----------

This is a new tool which displays regulator, sensor and clock tree
information.

Current version only displays regulator information and clock tree from
debugfs. Support will be added for sensors later.

Now we add gpio-change function for power consumption need.
When gpio is not in interrupt mode. use 'D' key to change gpio direction.
And when gpio direction is "out", use 'V' key to change gpio value.
